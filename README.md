# shoppinglist
This is an android app that was implemented using firebase as the backend. The user has to log in and enter the list of items he desires. The user has multiple options to enter the items such as voice recognization. Auto Completion is also available. Once the items are entered, the app displays the list of shops. The user can sort the list either by location(terms of distance from user) or by price. The user can also see the list of shops in form of mapview. 
The demo of the app can be viewed at this link-
